Description: Runs climate window analyses to detect the best 
    climatic windows for traits in consideration. Next, runs 
    structural equation models to assess the pathways from 
    climate to population growth (via traits and demographic
    rates). And, lastly, performs meta-analysis on the extracted
    path coefficients
